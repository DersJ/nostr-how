          <h4>0. Understanding keys</h4>
          <p>
            Each Nostr account is based on a private/public keypair. Your public
            key is your username and your private key is your password. Unlike a
            custodial service, you are responsible for keeping your private key
            safe, and it cannot be reset if lost. Therefore, we will use Alby, a
            bitcoin lightning wallet extension to manage your private key.
          </p>

          <h4>1. Install Alby Extension</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Best practice is to use a browser extension to manage your private
              key
            </li>
            <li>
              The Alby lightning wallet extension has built in support for Nostr
              (available for Chrome and Firefox)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="ms-4">
            Visit <a href="https://getalby.com/">getalby.com</a> and click the
            "Install Alby" button. Install the extension to your browser.
          </p>
          <p class="ms-4">
            During alby setup, you will be prompted to connect to a lightning
            wallet. If you do not have a wallet, continue with the alby wallet
            option and sign up for an alby account. If you already have a
            lightning wallet, you can connect to it.
          </p>

          <h4>2. Generate your private key</h4>
          <p>
            Once alby is installed and connected to a lightning wallet, navigate
            to the alby settings page. Scroll to the Nostr sectoin and click the
            "generate" button in the private key field. This will generate a
            private key and save it to your alby wallet. You can now use this
            private key to log into nostr.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Log into Nostr on a client</h4>
          <p>
            Now that you have a private key, you can log into nostr. But
            remember, Nostr is only a protocol, not an application, so you will
            need to use a Nostr client to access the network. For this guide
            we'll use Astral, a simple twitter-like web client.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Navigate to <a href="https://astral.ninja">astral.ninja</a></li>
            <li>
              In the login popup, click the "USE PUBLIC KEY FROM EXTENSION"
              button.
            </li>
            <li>Authorize key usage in the alby extension popup.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            You are logged in! It may take a few moments for content to start
            loading. From year you can follow friends (by searching for their
            pubkey), view different feeds, and post content.
          </p>

          <h4>4. Find friends</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you know someone on nostr, find their profile by searching
              thier public key.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many Twitter users are tweeting thier Nostr pubkeys with the
              hashtag
              <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23nostr&src=typed_query"
                >#nostr</a
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="nostr.directory">nostr.directory</a> is a database
              mapping twitter users to their nostr pubkeys
            </li>
          </ul>
