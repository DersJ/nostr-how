<h2>What is a NIP</h2>
<p>
  NIPs (Nostr Implementation Possibilities) document what MUST, what SHOULD and
  what MAY be implemented by Nostr-compatible relay and client software. See a
  complete list of nips
  <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>NIP-05</h2>
<p>
  NIP-05 enables a nostr user to map their public key to a DNS-based internet
  identifier. This allows a nostr user to be identified by a human-readable
  name, instead of a long, hard-to-remember public key. This is useful for a
  number of reasons, including the ability to easily share your identity with
  others, and the ability to use a human-readable name in place of a public key
  in a client.
</p>

<p>
  As explained in the
  <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md"
    >NIP-05 spec</a
  >, nostr clients will look for a <code>/.well-known/nostr.json</code> file at
  the root of the specified domain. This file must contain the nostr public key
  for the specified user.
</p>

<h2>How to set up a NIP-05 identifier</h2>

<h3>Option 1: Host a nostr.json file on your own domain</h3>
<p>
  If you already own a domain/website this is a good free option. You can add a
  .well-known/nostr.json file with your public key in a JSON object of the
  format
  <code>{ "names": { "NOSTR_NAME": "NOSTR_PUBKEY" }</code>. Make sure to serve
  this file with the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header set to
  <code>*</code>.
</p>

<h3>Option 1: Use an existing NIP-05 service</h3>
<p>
  If you don't want to set up your own nostr.json, you can take advantage of a
  NIP-05 service, such as <a href="https://nostrplebs.com/">nostrplebs.com</a>.
  In exchange for a handlefull of sats, you can add your public key to thier
  nostr.json.
